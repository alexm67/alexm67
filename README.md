- 👋 Hi, I’m @alexm67. As you may have guessed, my real name is Alexandre. I'm 22.
- 👀 I’m interested in biology, bioinformatics and biomechanics.
      I am also particularly interested in new computer technologies such as augmented reality, virtual reality, artificial intelligence and deep learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning high-throughput biology and bioinformatics. I will finish my master's degree in September 2021.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any subject I am interested on. A plus for me would be to combine augmented reality with biological knowledge to design new technologies.
